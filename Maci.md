### <b><u>This model has a UNIQUE save system in place!</u></b>

This means, you are able to create save states of the customizations you make and load them at anytime!

The outfit saves come PRE LOADED with saves that I find to be convenient but you can overwrite these with anything you want!

There are 2 separate save options available for:
* Outfit Toggles
* Outfit Colors
* Hair & Body Colors
* Misc - Shader settings, etc.
* All

The outfit saves come preloaded with 2 easy of access saves (These can be overwritten with your own options using the Save buttons):
* Load Save 1 - Loads a version of the casual outfits with no coat or pants.
* Load Save 2 - Loads the lingerie outfit.

This system was made and put in place by dor_. All credit and thanks goes to them!
